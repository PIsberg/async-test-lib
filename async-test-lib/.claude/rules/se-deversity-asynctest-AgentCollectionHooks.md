# Rules for AgentCollectionHooks

## Contract-Frozen Signature
- **Constraint**: You may change internal logic, but MUST NOT modify the method name, parameters, return type, or checked exceptions.
- **Reason**: Called from bytecode the agent rewrites, not from source: the method names and erased signatures are matched by CollectionAccessWeaver and cannot change independently of it. Every hook must end by performing the original operation and must never throw on the recording path - it runs inside the user's code, so an exception here surfaces as a failure in their test. Recording is best-effort by design: no context, a disabled detector, or a type the library knows is thread-safe all mean record nothing and delegate.
